## Python2 Midterm Project Nina Perišić


## Python Quiz
Ten simple questions about python programming language.
Score and player name are stored in an outside file.
Leaderboard shows top 10 recorded scores.


## TODO
    - Get the questions from a different file (questions.json)
    - Change the way scores are stored
        -- don't duplicate same scores for one player
        -- store all previous scores but display only the highest
    - Randomize answer options order
    - Add more questions (?)
